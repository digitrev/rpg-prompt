It might be a nomadic society, or one that maintains permanent settlements which are themselves mobile (e.g., flying cities, towns constructed on the backs of giant creatures, etc.); alternatively, the entire game may take place within some sort of large vehicle. Scenarios probably revolve around the particulars of various stops along the way.",

In a fantastical setting, the Sun may literally be occluded or missing; more commonly, there's some practical, cultural, or supernatural factor in play that encourages the player characters to confine their activites to hours after dark.
